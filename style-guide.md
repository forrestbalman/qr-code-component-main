# Front-end Style Guide

## Layout

The card has a max-width of 240px, so it should scale down to most mobile screens. I'm not too up to speed on conventions for screen sizes and responsiveness, but I just designed the site to be, hopefully, clear on mobile and centered so it can scale up to a larger screen.
