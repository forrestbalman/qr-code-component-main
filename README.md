## Overview

In this project I made a card with 3 inner components: an image, a title, and a body of text.

## My process

I used the approach suggested on the exercise page where I started with HTML, then styled it. My approach in the past had more styling as I wrote the HTML, so this was a good change.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS (written into the HTML file, no separate file)

### What I learned

I actually have several years of front end, and some server programming, experience. It's been about a year since I've developed seriously, and this has been a good warm up to refamiliarize me with an HTML file, and getting me to think about CSS selectors and Flexbox. This exercise is also good for getting me to document my projects better, since revisitng past code has been an issue I've had since I've started programming.

### Continued development

I don't think this needs to be iterated on, since its purpose to me was just to get me back in an HTML and starting to recognize things again.

### Useful resources

- https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ this was a good reminder that HTML comes preconfigured with color names, which saved me the trouble of having to use a color picker to get the exact shade of blue for the background
